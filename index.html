                Silky is a former 'special lovey' that belongs to Lake (age 4). A <dfn title="not required to share with brother">special lovey</dfn> is an object that is not required to be shared with a brother. Silky is a grey spotted harbor seal named after a prominent character in the popular childrens Netflix show "Puffin Rock." She was gifted to Lake by her best-friend Ellison in 2018 after he brought her back from the Newport aquarium. However, Silky did not rise to prominence until sometime in 2020. She was preceded in her special lovey status by pinky (a pink giraffe headed appended to a small blanket) and bun bun (a diminutive, robin's egg blue Jellycat easter bunny).

            <p>
                Silky has since been replaced in special lovey status by a new, very slightly different version of Silky, also conveniently named 'Silky', in late July 2021. New Silky was bought as a doppelganger of original Silky for Lake to bring to preschool. New Silky was followed in quick succession by Cheedy the cheetah in the beginning of August of the same year. Cheedy was a serendipidous garage sale free bin find and is now Lake's most trusted confidant.

                Silky has also acted in a cameo appearance in <a href="https://app.frame.io/presentations/a41f767b-b6d2-4143-a64d-8b7fd3789dfb">Space Lake 2: Jurassic Lark</a>. She does not yet have an IMDB page.
